/**
 * Similar to the Plugin annotation interface, but allows system operators to more easily effect
 * the files, as they are all grouped into one place. Having a directory of configuration files
 * is common in RPM packaging, because it is much easier and more correct to write a parallel
 * (non-conflicting) config file than to append or modify a config file from another package.
 *
 * When applied to a class, this annotation will cause the mrb-grinder to generate a properties
 * file (specific to this module) that includes basic module and class information and (if relevant)
 * the name of the class's shell-level entry point.
 *
 * The java properties file format was chosen because it is also easily readable by the common
 * unix shell (bash).
 *
 * A reactor is a somewhat general construct, in that the only mechanism supported is the discovery
 * of reactor entries (by the presence of a file in a directory). Everything else... including
 * which interfaces a client entry should implement, how the reactor actually loads the class, et
 * cetera... are all outside the scope of this project; and therefore (unlike the Plugin mechanism)
 * this ought to be usable even without the modular classloader being in use.
